- **Backend**: The backend is deployed on Render, providing a robust and scalable infrastructure to handle weather data requests.

## How to Use

1. **Enter Location**: Simply enter the name of the location you want to check the weather for in the provided input field.
2. **View Weather**: WeatherMan will fetch the current weather conditions and display them along with the forecast.
3. **Location-based Weather**: Click on the option to fetch weather based on your current coordinates.
4. **Temperature Conversion**: Toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit to view the temperature in your preferred metric.
5. **Note**: Since I am using a free account of Render, the backend can take time to load/reload due to inactivity. So sometimes, users may need to "double-click" the search icon to properly search for the location. However, it only happens for the first time and ceases after that.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
